    Sumatra:{
      name: "Sumatra",
      origin: "Sumatra is a beautiful Indonesian island in Southeast Asia known in ancient times as the Island of Gold, because of its rich gold deposits. Coffee was introduced to Indonesia by the Dutch traders and colonialists in the 18th century. Today, Sumatra is the largest producer of Indonesian coffee with Indonesia being the fourth largest coffee producer in the world.",
      originsource: "https://treescoffee.com/blog/2016/05/single-origin-coffee-profile-sumatra/",
      flavour:"Coffees from Sumatra are known for smooth, sweet body that is balanced and intense. Depending on the region, or blend of regions, the flavours of the land and processing can be very pronounced. Notes of cocoa, tobacco, smoke, earth and cedar wood can show well in the cup. Occasionally, Sumatran coffees can show greater acidity, which balances the body. This acidity takes on tropical fruit notes and sometimes an impression of grapefruit or lime.",

    Columbia:{
      name: "Columbia",
      origin: "During the period between 1905 and 1935 the coffee industry in Colombia grew dynamically thanks to the vision and long term politics derived from the creation of the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia (National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia) in 1927. The union of local farmers and small producers around the Federation permitted them to confront logistical and commercial difficulties that would not have been possible individually. With time and through the research made at Cenicafé, founded in 1938, and the Federation's agricultural Extension Service, improved cultivation systems. More efficient spatial patterns were developed that permitted the differentiation of the product and supported its quality. Currently the Land of Coffee in Colombia includes all of the mountain ranges and other mountainous regions of the country, and generates income for over 500,000 coffee farming families.",
      originsource: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Colombia#From_1905_to_1907_to_the_present",
      flavour:"Colombia coffee reviews tend to note it as medium-bodied with a rich taste and citrus-like acidity. The best high-grown Colombian coffee typifies the classic Latin American mild, fruity  flavor though not the type of fruity taste that seems almost fermented.",

    Guatemala:{
      name: "Guatemala",
      origin: "Coffee trees were originally brought to Guatemala by Jesuit missionaries in the mid-1700s as ornamental plants. It wasn’t until the mid-1800s, when the invention of synthetic dyes devastated Guatemala’s indigo and cochineal dye industries, that the country began growing coffee commercially on a sizeable scale. By 1880, 90 percent of Guatemala’s exports were coffee. Aside from 1940, when exports were suspended due to World War II, coffee has remained Guatemala’s largest export. The country today is particularly known for its specialty-grade coffee. Although the country ranked tenth in the world in total coffee production in 2015, it often is second (behind Colombia) in production of high-grade coffee.",
      originsource: "https://driftaway.coffee/origin-spotlight-guatemala/",
      flavour:"Coffee beans grown in Guatemala typically have tasting notes indicating a full body and a rich chocolatey-cocoa flavor, and a toffee-like sweetness. Guatemalan coffees are true central American coffees.",

    Yemen:{
      name: "Yemen",
      origin: "Coffee, as we know it, would simply not exist without Yemen. For nearly two centuries, beginning in the 1500s, all of the coffee consumed anywhere in the world was grown in Yemen. The coffee trees that spurred entire industries in other countries, from Indonesia to Brazil, came from Yemen, too. Even coffee’s name bears the imprint of the Arabian Peninsula, coming from the word quawah, a metonym for wine. The country’s enduring impact is incontrovertible, but its story is obscured by today’s reality: A war that began in 2015 has become “the world’s largest humanitarian crisis,” according to the United Nations. In addition to ongoing Saudi-led airstrikes and on-the-ground fighting, an unprecedented cholera outbreak and widespread food shortages threaten millions of civilians’ lives. Last year, we were fortunate enough to partner with Port of Mokha, a coffee export company whose mission is to revive Yemen’s coffee economy by linking farmers to the specialty market. To do this, they must build the supply-chain infrastructure from the ground up. Their goal is nothing short of giving farmers, whose coffee lineage goes back centuries, a viable future in the midst of war. ",
      originsource: "https://blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/posts/coffee-origins-yemen",
      flavour:"Grown traditionally without chemicals (e.g., organic) in Yemen, Mocha is a wild, dry processed (natural) coffee, usually full-bodied with a rich, winey acidity.  The dry processed and rather wild coffee with a full body, winey acidity and deep earthy tones. The musky fruitiness gives way to a wonderful chocolaty finish. This is a lively coffee with spice notes of cardamom and cinnamon as well as dry fruits such as raisins and pleasant sweet spice notes. The flavor is often described as complex, very earthy and deep, and with a distinct pungency. Yemen Mocha may also exhibit a musky fruitiness, and a chocolaty aftertaste.",
